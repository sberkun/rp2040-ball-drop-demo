# Construction of the Tunneling Ball Demonstration


The tunneling ball demonstration mainly consists of a rapidly spinning disk, and a small ball bearing that drops through a small hole in the disk. The point of this demonstration is to precisely time the movement of the disk
such that the ball bearing can fall through; a successful "tunnel" shows the timing capabilities of the system.
