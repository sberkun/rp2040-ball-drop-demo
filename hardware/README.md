# Construction of the Tunneling Ball Demonstration


The tunneling ball demonstration mainly consists of a rapidly spinning disk, and a small bearing ball that drops through a small hole in the disk. The point of this demonstration is to precisely time the movement of the disk
such that the ball can fall through; a successful "tunnel" shows the timing capabilities of the system.

Top image: first version of the demonstration. The frame is made of scraps of 1/8th inch thick plywood, and the motor is clamped to the frame. The breadboard is a structural element.

Bottom image: second version of the demonstration, with a 3d printed frame. The breadboard is no longer a structural element and is behind the frame.
